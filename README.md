# quizApp
quiz App Engine focused on coding questions with spaced-repetition learning feature

2/18/2018

I am building a Quiz App as a project as I am nearing completion of the back-end for Code Carrer Academy's coding bootcamp.

My goal is to use the "forgetting curve" idea and "spaced-repetition" learning in order to implant the learning into
long-term memory.  I will also use this as a mechanism as a means of forced-learning of some algorithm work after
coding bootcamp is done.

I will be developing a blog about the project as well as sharing the application with others.  Stay tuned!
